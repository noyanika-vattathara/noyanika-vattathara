# About me


Hi, my name is Noya Vattathara, my pronouns are she/her, and I am an Echols and College Science Scholar at the University of Virginia â˜º. I am interested in neuroscience, public policy, computer science, and data science. I am hoping to pursue a career at the intersections of these areas in the future! You can reach me at noyanika.v@gmail.com. 

Apart from my academic interests, my other involvements include volunteering for women's safety, debate, research, and advocacy. In my spare time, I love to read philosophy, bake, and play the piano. ðŸŽ¶
