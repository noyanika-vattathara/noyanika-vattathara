# About me


**noyanika-vattathara/noyanika-vattathara** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hi, my name is Noya Vattathara, my pronouns are she/her, and I am an Echols and College Science Scholar at the University of Virginia ☺. I am interested in neuroscience, public policy, computer science, and data science. I am hoping to pursue a career at the intersections of these areas in the future! You can reach me at noyanika.v@gmail.com. 

Apart from my academic interests, my other involvements include volunteering for women's safety, debate, research, and advocacy. In my spare time, I love to read philosophy, bake, and play the piano. 🎶
